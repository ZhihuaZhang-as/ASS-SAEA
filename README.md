# ASS-SAEA
A dynamic model management strategy based on adaptive surrogate selection (ASS) is proposed to identify an appropriate surrogate model to assist the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm faced with complex problems.                                                                                                                                 
The dynamic characteristics of the strategy are revealed in two aspects: the first is adaptive selection of the appropriate surrogate model, which can better describe the landscape of the problem in the current search space, and the second is dynamic switching between global and local modeling.                                     
The most uncertain sample was also considered for searching the unexplored region and escaping from the local optimum.                        
The algorithm is verified on 10 benchmark functions and the coal gasification process.
